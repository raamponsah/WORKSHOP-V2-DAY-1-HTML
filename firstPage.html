            <h2>Bicycles for Green</h2>
            <p>
                To stay healthy and maintain good health, we do different types of exercise. But the best exercise is cycling and swimming. Cycling involves a lot of physical exertion and helps greatly in weight loss. Besides this, it greatly reduces the risk of cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases and maintains fitness.

Many who have seen professional cyclists may have noticed most of them are in excellent health. Cycling not only keeps us fit externally, but it also keeps us healthy internally.

                Cycling is considered to be an efficient means of transportation and very effective for short to medium distances. Bicycles have more advantages than motor vehicles.

For example, cycling allows for permanent physical exercise due to easy parking, increased ability to move easily, etc. It will enable easy access to roads, bicycle paths, and rural roads.

Cycling also benefits from using limited fossil fuels, low air and noise pollution, and very low traffic jams. This dramatically reduces the financial cost of the user as well as society.
